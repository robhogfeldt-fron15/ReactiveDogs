# Reactive Dogs
This is an app I tinker with while learning ReactJS. It´s where I put together all the bits and pieces from various books, videos and other learning resources into a project of my own in order to get a better understanding of the framework.

### Is it even completed?
Nope...Its a work in progress and there are features and designs that are only half-implemented as you´ll see.

### Allright, What does it do?
My girlfriend has got a lot of dogs. Nine german shepherds to be exact. This is an app that lets her keep track of events, results and the dogs themeselves

### Ok, Good for her, what´s in it for me?
Well, the code is available on github and it might contain something useful for you.

###Did you use any boilerplate-code?
Yes, the excellent webpack-express-boilerplate by Christian Alfoni:

### webpack-express-boilerplate
A boilerplate for running a Webpack workflow in Node express
